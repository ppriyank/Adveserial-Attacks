How can I be of assistance to you today?
Hello. I was in your store this past weekend and bought a few items. Yesterday, my friend told me that the annual anniversary sales'd begun. It turned out she bought the same sweater as I did but for a much lower price.
Yes. Our anniversary sales started on Monday. We do offer price adjustments within seven days of purchase to ensure our customers' satisfaction.
