Welcome!
Hi, thanks for having me on your show.
Thank you for joining us. So please tell us, why did you decide to open a café?
Well, we saw the opportunity to offer something a little special and different from other establishments. Cafés certainly are a very competitive market sector. There are more than plenty in our city, and we felt they are all rather similar to each other. Wouldn't you agree?
