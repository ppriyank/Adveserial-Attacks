The third type is known as the behavioral interview. The questions are usually designed to find out about how the candidates handle tricky situations in the past. A typical question might be "Can you give me an example of a situation where you had to follow orders that you didn't agree with?" This opens up a lot of information and the interviewer gets to see more of the candidate.
