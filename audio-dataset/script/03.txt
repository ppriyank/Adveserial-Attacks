I have a good feeling about this house.
If you like the outside, you are going to really love the inside.
What a beautiful home! And I like the way the window screen gives you privacy from the street.
Follow me into the kitchen. You will love it!
Wow, they put a wine storage area in the kitchen. I love it!
The best part is the bedroom and the attached bathroom.
I love the relaxing colors of the wall and floor covering.
