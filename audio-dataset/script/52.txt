Have you ever found one of your books at a second-hand bookstore?
Yes. That kind of thing is difficult. If they've got my book there, I think "Well, this is an insult! Somebody didn't want to keep my book." But if it's not there, I feel it's an insult too. I think, "Why aren't people exchanging my book? Why isn't it in this store?"
