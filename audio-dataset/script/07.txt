Last night the news said that in some cities they are thinking of turning off the public water supply during part of each day.
Mmm... There is a shortage of water here, too. Is there anything we could do to help? Water is so important.
Sure. There are many things we can do to cut down the amount of water we use. One is change some of the things in the bathroom.
