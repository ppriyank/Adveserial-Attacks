Our notes say that we arranged for an engineer to visit your house yesterday. Did he check the electricity?
No, he didn't. Five minutes after he arrived, he had an emergency call and left.
I'm very sorry. I can arrange for another engineer to visit you on Wednesday.
Ok, but I have a meeting that morning. Do you have an exact time for his visit?
Is two o'clock OK for you?
Yes, that's fine. Thank you.
No problem.
