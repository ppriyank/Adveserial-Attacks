I guess something in the vicinity of 30 or 40 would be good. Which type would you recommend?
I would say the safest option is always a red wine. They are generally more popular than whites, and can usually be paired with food more easily. Our specialty here are Italian wines, and these tend to be fruity with medium acidity.
