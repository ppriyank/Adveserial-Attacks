Hello. Peter. I heard you worked in a remote village last month.
Yes, as a volunteer teaching in a primary school in southeastern China.
A good choice for the summer vacation.
For me, it's not only a choice, but a responsibility.
You're right. What can a volunteer generally do?
Many things, like creating a change in the surroundings, providing shelter and food to the needy ones.
