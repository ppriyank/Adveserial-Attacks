Hey, there. How are you?
Oh, hi. I'm great! Thanks. And you look great, too.
Thank you. It's good to see you shopping at the organic section. I see you've got lots of healthy stuff. I wish I could buy more organic produce from here, but I find the kids don't like it. I don't know about yours, but mine are all about junk food.
Oh, trust me! I know exactly how you feel. My children are the same.
