You see, in the south of Spain, it gets very hot in the summer, up to 40 degree Celsius. So a cold gazpacho is very refreshing. The main ingredients are tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, olive oil and stale bread.
Stale bread? Surely you mean bread for dipping into the soup?
No. Bread is crushed and blended in like everything else. It adds texture and thickness to the soup.
