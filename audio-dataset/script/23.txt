Can you tell us about your group?
Well, we were all high school students from the US. But we were very different.
You mean from different cities, with different religions and cultures?
Yes, and I was existed about that. We learnt that we weren't really so different.
What do you mean?
Well, we became such good friends. More than friends, we were like a family.
