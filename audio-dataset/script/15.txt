How do you feel about the climb, Mike?
It was a lot more difficult than we had expected, but we persevered and made it.
Why did you choose to conquer such a height?
We regard this as a chance to prove the human spirit.
Really a tough journey. What did you do in time of a difficulty?
We turned to each other for inspiration as we continued on the way to the peak.
