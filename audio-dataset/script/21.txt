Well, I own a small data processing company, in which I employ about eight to ten workers. And the point I want to make has to do with trust. I know it's possible to force people to be 100% efficient. But I think when you do that, you lose confidence and trust. I let my employees use our equipment and make personal phone calls. They are more than welcome to decide what is right and wrong.
