Many aspects are different here at the university. The most important one is that you have to take more individual responsibility for your actions. It's up to your own self-discipline - how much efforts you put into study. Living in college dormitories, there are no parents to tell you that study harder or stop wasting time. Lectures have hundreds of students and they are not going to follow you up or question you if you miss the lectures.
