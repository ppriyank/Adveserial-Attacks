What is it with kids these days and all that junk food they eat? I think it's all that advertising on TV. That's where they get it.
Yes, it must be. My children see something on TV and they immediately want it. It's like they don't realize it's just an advertisement.
Right. And practically everything that's advertised for children is unhealthy processed foods. No surprise then it becomes a battle for us parents to feed our children ordinary fruit and vegetables.
