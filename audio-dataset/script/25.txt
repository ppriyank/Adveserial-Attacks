Did you bake the cookies here at the party tonight?
Yes, I got the idea from a magazine.
They're delicious! You've got nothing to worry about. You are a natural.
You really think so?
If you hadnâ€™t told me that. I would have guessed they were baked by the restaurant. You know, with your event planning experience you could very well open your own shop.
