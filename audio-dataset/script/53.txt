What does it feel like when you finally finish a book?
It's funny you ask that, because I never have this moment when I feel "Ah, I've finished!" I watch footballers at the end of the match, you know; the whistle goes and they've won or lost. Until then, they've been giving everything they have, and at that moment they know it's over. It's funny for an author. There's never a finishing whistle.
