Transport for London has a lost property office, which collects the items left behind as people flow through the city's transport system each day. It is the biggest lost property office in Europe, beaten globally only by Tokyo's. 65 staffs sort through hundreds of thousands of lost and forgotten items each at the office, which is run by Paul Coan.
