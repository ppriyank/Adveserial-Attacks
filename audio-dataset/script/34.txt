Hi, professor. I was hoping I could have a moment of your time if you're not too busy. I'm having some problems getting started on my dissertation, and I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to begin.
Sure. I have quite a few students, though. So can you remind me what your topic is?
The general topic I chose is aesthetics, but that's as far as I've got. I don't really know where to go from there.
Yeah. That's much too large a topic. You really need to narrow it down in order to make it more accessible.
