What do you like most about the airport environment?
Well, I really appreciate the daylight.
Daylight?
Yes, the windows here make it seems if you are outside. Another thing I like is the moving walkways. You don't have to walk for miles to the boarding gate.
I see. Anything you don't like?
The shops are often overcrowded. There is no enough space to move around comfortably, and also I suppose the trollies are too small.
