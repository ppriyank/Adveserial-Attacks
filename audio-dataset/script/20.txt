How about your school work?
That was fine. I was able to get my school work done with good grades. My only problem was that I had so much physical energy that I could not sit still in class. Then some teachers started taking my skateboard away.
That couldn't stop you from staking?
No way. The cool thing was that my parents managed to find me a different school.
